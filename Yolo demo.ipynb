    "YOLOv8 is a software which employs artificial intelligence for object detection and pose detection. The software was first built to classify certain objects, which it does quite well. YOLO can detect people, dogs, cars, and many more objects in images and videos. The objects are placed within bounding boxes that also state the confidence level. More recent versions have built upon the object detection software so that it can be used for pose detection. Utilizing YOLOv8's pose detection capabilities, we can pinpoint key points on the human body, such as shoulders, hips, and crucial facial features in static images and video footage. This can be used to track body movements in video for research or projects and potentially aid in animation."
